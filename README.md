# Toxic-Comment-Classification-NLP-LSTM
NLP Classification of Toxic Comment from Jigsaw Conversation AI using LSTM and GloVe PreTrained Model
 
GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
